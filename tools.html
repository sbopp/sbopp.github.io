	<p>Excellent tools are an indespensible part of any scientist's or engineer's daily needs. For experimentalists, this need is immediately corporeal (as compared sometimes to the almost ethereal feeling of SSHing into a supercomputer in a different part of the country which may at the time be your primary tool), manifesting as steel, titanium, glass, diamond, etc... There are all manner of qualities when it comes to tools and an interesting cost function of quality vs. price. At every instance in the following list(s), unless otherwise stated, I have tried to find an optimal solution miximizing the quality at a reasonably minimal price. That being said however, these items are usually not inexpensive but will (if treated properly) last for a <em>very</em> long time. There is also a slightly more difficult to explain value of high quality tools whcih relates to how you feel when you are using them: when a machine or system is down and it's late at night where there's nobody around to help you fix it, when all the creaky, groany sounds of a lab in the middle of the night are creeping you out and your expensive, slightly non-functioning machine is fighting against you, it's very comforting to know that your tools are definitely not going to fight against you too. High quality tools work with you and not against you.
  </p>
  <p>I'd like to make availible here a list of tools I find to be of excellent quality or having uncommonly useful features. My attempts to find tools are not limited to location of manufacture but I do attempt mostly to stick to those manufactured in the United States, England, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland (not an exhaustive list). This is intended to be a 'living' list and therefore is subject to periodic updates, please check back once in a while to see if there have been any new additions to the list. Thanks for reading! Also, consider modifying your own tools to suit your specific needs, I do this very frequently and am generally much more efficient as a result. Be wary to make sure that, if you intend to find or purchase any of the tools for yourself, you should make every effort to ensure that the quality and other specifications of interest have not changed since the time of this writing. Additionally, some of these tools, even as of years or decades ago, have been out of production and are therefore only available on the secondary market so sites like eBay and Craigslist are sometimes my go-to for attaining out of production tools.

        <span class="book_description"> Pliers and gripping tools speak for themselves but they are (for anyone familiar) very clearly not all manufactured to the same quality and tolerances. There are too many possibilities to make an extremely exhaustive list of all my favorites but some that I own for my personal and professional use are included below. The German-made Knipex I find can hardly do any wrong when it comes to the specific pliers that I have purchased and tested; they're tremendously durable and have wicked style that I really appreciate; that being said, they're expensive at an average of maybe $30-60 per pair depending on the model (a cost I've never regretted however). The American-made Utica 'triple diamond' pliers have some extremely useful models but have been out of manufacture for many decades now, if you can find them on the secondary market, I'd highly recommend picking up a pair of their 82-8 pliers. The Japanese-made KING TTC pliers I also find to be of reasonably high quality at lower expense than the Knipex pliers, I use them for travling tool kits most frequently (one caveat with KING-TTC is their yellow-green vinyl handles can stain from other paint). </span> <br>
