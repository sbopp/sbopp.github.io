	<p>Excellent tools are an indespensible part of any scientist's or engineer's daily needs. For experimentalists, this need is immediately corporeal (as compared sometimes to the almost ethereal feeling of SSHing into a supercomputer in a different part of the country which may at the time be your primary tool), manifesting as steel, titanium, glass, diamond, etc... There are all manner of qualities when it comes to tools and an interesting cost function of quality vs. price. At every instance in the following list(s), unless otherwise stated, I have tried to find an optimal solution miximizing the quality at a reasonably minimal price. That being said however, these items are usually not inexpensive but will (if treated properly) last for a <em>very</em> long time. There is also a slightly more difficult to explain value of high quality tools whcih relates to how you feel when you are using them: when a machine or system is down and it's late at night where there's nobody around to help you fix it, when all the creaky, groany sounds of a lab in the middle of the night are creeping you out and your expensive, slightly non-functioning machine is fighting against you, it's very comforting to know that your tools are definitely not going to fight against you too. High quality tools work with you and not against you.
  </p>
  <p>I'd like to make availible here a list of tools I find to be of excellent quality or having uncommonly useful features. My attempts to find tools are not limited to location of manufacture but I do attempt mostly to stick to those manufactured in the United States, England, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Switzerland (not an exhaustive list). This is intended to be a 'living' list and therefore is subject to periodic updates, please check back once in a while to see if there have been any new additions to the list. Thanks for reading! Also, consider modifying your own tools to suit your specific needs, I do this very frequently and am generally much more efficient as a result. Be wary to make sure that, if you intend to find or purchase any of the tools for yourself, you should make every effort to ensure that the quality and other specifications of interest have not changed since the time of this writing. Additionally, some of these tools, even as of years or decades ago, have been out of production and are therefore only available on the secondary market so sites like eBay and Craigslist are sometimes my go-to for attaining out of production tools.

        <span class="book_description"> Pliers and gripping tools speak for themselves but they are (for anyone familiar) very clearly not all manufactured to the same quality and tolerances. There are too many possibilities to make an extremely exhaustive list of all my favorites but some that I own for my personal and professional use are included below. The German-made Knipex I find can hardly do any wrong when it comes to the specific pliers that I have purchased and tested; they're tremendously durable and have wicked style that I really appreciate; that being said, they're expensive at an average of maybe $30-60 per pair depending on the model (a cost I've never regretted however). The American-made Utica 'triple diamond' pliers have some extremely useful models but have been out of manufacture for many decades now, if you can find them on the secondary market, I'd highly recommend picking up a pair of their 82-8 pliers. The Japanese-made KING TTC pliers I also find to be of reasonably high quality at lower expense than the Knipex pliers, I use them for travling tool kits most frequently (one caveat with KING-TTC is their yellow-green vinyl handles can stain from other paint). </span> <br>

     <span class="book_description"> Hex keys (as I prefer to refer to them) are another self-explainatory sector. If you're into work on optical systems or most machinery (lots of scientific tools as well) then hex-cap machine screws are ubiquitous. Not all are made the same but some brands I like are Bondhus (USA) and Picquic (Canada); that being said, PB Swiss makes fantastic tools but I think they're overpriced for similar quality to those previously mentioned. </span> <br>

     <span class="book_description"> Another self-explainer. There's too much variety to really explain well here but I find that extremely important factors are having a very hard, durable working end as well as a durable, slip-resistant handle are essential to a good screwdriver. Be wary of tools with acetate handles (because they decay over time with butyric acid, whcih smells like vomit, as a product) and also of tools with squishy rubber handles becuase they frequently will decay substantially when subject to contact with oils. Some of the brands that I prefer are Wiha, and Felo (both German-made). PB Swiss and Snapon are additionally excellent and I have one or two of their tools for my own personal uses that warrant the expense, however I generally recommend to stick with Wiha or others of comperable quality because they (for the most part) do the job just as well as more expensive brands.  </span> <br>

     <span class="book_title"> Wrenches, Ratchets, and Sockets </span> <br>
     <span class="book_authors">
     <span class="book_citation">  </span> <br>
     <span class="book_description"> Wrenches, ratchets, and sockets are a more nuanced category of tools and, unfortunately, the more expensive brands like Snap-on (USA) and Nepros (Japan) have a massive lead on quality and value compared to many others. In more bang-for-the-buck fashion, I do like S-K sockets compared to many other brands besides Snap-on and Nepros but it's really hard evidently to match their quality. Tekton is a servicable value-based replacement for many of the wrenches, ratchets, and sockets made by other manufacturers but the feeling in the hand of Tekton (made in Taiwan) is not of comparable quality to Nepros or Snap-on. That being said, as much as I do love Snap-on and Nepros wrenches, I don't use wrenches to the extent necessary to justify the cost, that's where I think that more value-based brands like S-K (at the higher end, especially with their student discounts) and Tekton are a good value proposition. </span> <br>

     <span class="book_description"> I am not a professional machinist but I do have experience macnining starting in the early 2000s and have some mature opinions on tool quality and value. Overall, Starrett has never done any wrong when it comes to quality of tools in my consideration, that being said, literally every Starrett tool I've ever owned has been second-hand because they are admittedly extremely expensive. Starrett (USA, mostly), and Mitutoyo (Japan) are in my top recommended brands of machinist tools that are currently being manufactured, however second hand tools from Lufkin (USA) and Brown & Sharpe (USA) are of comparable quality when in good condition. In the land of machinist tools, accuracy is the be-all end-all and Starrett is worldwide known for excellence, plus they just look really fantastic, feel good to use, and last forever when treated well (for example, a portion of my Starrett tools came from my great grandfather who was a machinist). </span> <br>

     <span class="book_authors">
     <span class="book_citation">  </span> <br>
     <span class="book_description"> Sharp is sharp but durable and sharp is a different story. Scalpels, razors, and knives are an indespensible part of almost every experimental lab for all kinds of fabrication and experimental setup. For scalpels, my favorite brand is Swann Morton (England) and particularly their #7 handle. For razors, my general favorite is NT Cutter (Japan) as well as some of the nicer teflon-coated double-edge razors from Voskhod. Plastic razors I find to be almost universally the same in terms of quality and hardness but unbelievabley useful in so many situations. Knives in general for utility are split into a few categories, the main two being razor knives, and pocket knives: razor knives I think that the Stanley 99E razor knife is hard to beat and inexpensive as well; for pocket knives (which I generally do not carry on my person for various reasons) I find that Spyderco's Delica 4 FFG is one of the best quality for the price tools that I've ever found. Craft knives are also not all the same, the X-ACTO type are ubiquitous but generally poorly made, a replacement whcih is on my list to purchase is made by a manufacturer called County-Comm and is completely titanium with a screw enclosure for its blade so that it can be more safely stored and solves the problem of the collet loosening over the life of the tool since it is made of titanium compared to the aluminum of X-ACTO. Additionally, for glass cutting specifically, Mitsuboshi (Japan) is by far and away the best hand-held glass cutter I've ever used, others more or less do not work at all in any scientifically-useful capacity. </span> <br>
