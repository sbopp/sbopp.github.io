            <p>Clean spaces and clean rooms are indespensible tools in many industry segments including optics, semiconductor and electronic manufacturng, surgery, and phramaceuticals. These spaces have a wide variety of certifications and features but all provide the same general functionality of a space with a reduced count of particles per unit volume compared to the ambient environment in order to prevent damage to devices or products that would occur from the incorporation of those particles into the final product. Clean spaces, even small ones, can be astronomically expensive to construct, maintain, and operate. Here I attempt to share the design, rationalization, bill of mateirals, and concept for a small, modular clean space made from commonly available parts for a price of ~$2500 plus the cost of fan filter units. This information is valuable in order to provide rapid access to clean spaces for small startups or laboratories without the excessive cost of prefabricated or custom-built clean spaces.</p>
