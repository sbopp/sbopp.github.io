    	<p>My philosophy with tools is that you should have what you need with you and easily accessable for when necessity or inspiration strikes. Having a personal set of tools that I use and am an expert with is one way that I implement this ready accessibility. Any tool in your aersonal should extend your capability. Specifically tools for use in the clean room need to extend capabilities while not contributing to atmospheric particulate and ideally being highly resitant or impervious to solvents and heat. Stainless steel and PTFE are obviously excellent choices but beyond that there are many possibillities. Furthermore, never be afraid to modify or otherwise enhance functionality of tools if you can benefit from the modification. In the same vein, invent new tools that suit your needs more exactly than what may be available; or of something isnt available at the time you need it, improvise and make something that can. You're smart. Figure it out. Get it done. No excuses. Invest some of your own money on a set of tools that are high quality and a joy to use, you shouldn't have to fight agains what you're using, that will pay dividends in the future. Wasting time searching for the tool you need is unfruitful and the value you waste searching is ususally much less than the cost of a tool for youself. Also, take care of what you have and it should last a very long time. </p>
      <p>Tweezers are a good starting place: have more than you need and a wide variety too. The same can be said for cutting tools, have razors (plastic and metal), scalpels, and scissors in your kit. A diamond scribe too for cleaving and scratching is nearly indespensible for many things. To put things back together I love super glue (Zap brand adhesives are some of my favorites) and epoxy (TorrSeal is my undoubted go-to), tape too is indespensible and I love JVCC silicone splicing tape (the gree stuff) becuase of its enormously superior properties to nearly anything else you can fing (e.g. high stregth, low surface fouling, high heat resistance, etc ...), and kapton too for the odd case that silicond adhesives don't stick to what youre working on (as is the case for PLA plastics in my experience).
