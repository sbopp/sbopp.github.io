            <p>Clean spaces and clean rooms are indespensible tools in many industry segments including optics, semiconductor and electronic manufacturng, surgery, and phramaceuticals. These spaces have a wide variety of certifications and features but all provide the same general functionality of a space with a reduced count of particles per unit volume compared to the ambient environment in order to prevent damage to devices or products that would occur from the incorporation of those particles into the final product. Clean spaces, even small ones, can be astronomically expensive to construct, maintain, and operate. Here I attempt to share the design, rationalization, bill of mateirals, and concept for a small, modular clean space made from commonly available parts for a price of ~$2500 plus the cost of fan filter units. This information is valuable in order to provide rapid access to clean spaces for small startups or laboratories without the excessive cost of prefabricated or custom-built clean spaces.</p>

            <p>The small, modular clean space described in the following was designed using FreeCAD with the popular and low cost strut channel building material in mind. The space measures 8 ft x 8 ft x 8 ft with a small 4 ft x 4 ft x 8 ft gowning area and is covered on all sides by plastic sheeting: this is in an attempt to reduce costs of a soft sided clean room compared to the normal construction method using thick vinyl sheeting to cover the sides whcih is substantially expensive. While the plastic sheeting may billow to some extent with the fan filter units (FFUs) running, this shoudl cause no trouble with cleanliness of the space. Plastic sheeting is attached at regular intervals to the strut channel with binder clips, elminiating the need to screw or bolt the soft sides to the strut channel and increasing the modularity while decreasing the time for construction. Soft sides additionally make an easier job of lighting a clean space since light can be shone into the space externally, eliminating the need for more expensive clean room light sources to a large extent. A bill of materials for the clean space is included as it was purchased from McMaster Carr for ease of reproduction by the reader.</p>

            <img src="/img/Clean_Room_Final_3.png" alt="Final visual appearance of the modular clean room" style="float:center;width:50%;height:50%;">

            <p>The design includes structure for a workbench built into the strucutre as well as channels on the roof where fan filter units can be installed. The FFUs are not included in the price listed. Additionally, plastic sheeting is not included in the bill of materials because it can be found more easily online. The author recommends sheets of approximately 9 ft x 12 ft which can cover entire sides of the clean space in one unbroken piece of material and have some to spare for attachement to the strut channel structure. Other tools such as a strut channel socket ratchet attachment are highly recommended although not strictly necessary. Vinyl door flaps on the gowning chanber or a zippered plastic door may be more usable than thin plastic sheeting for the entryway as that gets more use than the sides of the clean space. It is worthy to note that this clean space is overbuilt in terms of strength, however the rigidity of the structure and modularity make up for that due to the expandaility as well as the security when operating with several heavy FFUs overhead.</p>

            <p>Of merit to the design is its modularity. Because it is made from strut channel, any of the large pieces of the assembly can be duplicated and added in with little additional effort. That is to say, if you would like to add another room to the clean space, it can be as simple as constructing another box on any of its walls, or as complex as building another interlocking chamber to a deeper clean room with a higher ISO standard. Modularity and strength of construction are key to the design.</p>
