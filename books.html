	<p>Excellent books that teach you somethign new and worthwile are a treasure, and finding them is a fun experinece. Some of my favorite places to find books (admittedly these are a hit or miss most of the time) are library book sales, thrift shops, and used book stores. Electronic copies of most books and articles that you could want can frequently be found on the websites of university libraries, especially in the case of the Univeristy of California system. Thrifting and book store shopping are most frequently best for nearly random discovery, whereas searching the internet and libraries are more often targeted with prior knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>I'd like to make availible here a list of books I've stumbled upon nearly randomly in some cases, and been referred to or found after careful searching in other cases that generally related to science and engineering (with a heavy slant toward materials) that I feel are uncommonly valuable. There is a wide breadth in subject matter and diveristy in authorship, and date of publication in the texts shared here but I find that these things are generally invartiant of quality. Please enjoy, and if you feel you have recommentations of books that are specifically valuable, please share them with me! This is a continuously updated list: stay tuned-in.

    <section id="book">
      <div class="container">
        <span class="book_title"> Molecular Scinece and Molecular Engineering </span> <br>
        <span class="book_authors"> Arthur R. Von Hippel, et al.
        <span class="book_citation"> Technology Press Books in Science and Enginnering (1959) </span> <br>
        <span class="book_description"> Covering broad topics related to molecular engineering like growth and perfection of crystals, piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics, a very accessable treatment of condensed matter physics, and excellent fundamentals in microwave science, this 446 page text rich in well-devised technical viewgraphs, diagrams, and descriptions is well worth a read of many sections, even considering its admitteldy middle of the last century publication date. I pleasently stubled upon this one in sept. 2019 at Powell's used books in Portland Oregon.</span> <br>

   <div class="container">
     <span class="book_title"> Principles of Superconductive Devices and Circuits </span> <br>
     <span class="book_authors"> T. Van Duzer, and C. W. Turner
     <span class="book_citation"> Elseiver North Holland, Inc. (1981) </span> <br>
     <span class="book_description"> Exactly as its name might imply, this is THE book on engineering superconductive devices. Exhaustively covering theory, electrodynamics, and a wide variety of device applications in suporconductivity Turner and Duzer put together the best book on the subject that I've ever seen. This text was recommended to me by my professor and mentor from ASU Nathan Newman. </span> <br>
