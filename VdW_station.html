        <p>Van der Waals (VdW) transfer and assembly have led to many exciting innovations in the ways that nanostructures can be fabricated and the properties that they can have. In his 2016 thesis entitled 'Ballistic Conduction in Graphene Heterostructures’, M. Lee shows some of his VdW materials assembly station but I think that his plans are not complete as presented in the text and, on my own journey to create a similar system for my own research, I have assembled a set of plans and photographs about my construction of a VdW materials assembly station. Some of the components were sourced from my group's laboratory since we had them lying around, however many were purchased new. Every attempt has been made to replicate the list of components and give a reasonable estimate of pricing for the items used in the VdW station. </p>

        <p>The system is designed to have several degrees of freedom and also accommodate a reflection-mode microscope and be in as compact of a form factor as is feasible. To eliminate redundant degrees of freedom, in my system I only include one xy translation stage and a separate z translation stage which are mounted together with a goniometer that has a magnetic clamp which holds glass slides securely. A simplified diagram of the system (from the M. Lee method) is attached below. </p>

          </div>
        </section>

        <p>The overall idea behind the VdW assembly station is to have a system with x, y, and z translational control, and three degrees of rotational control as well: two on a goniometer, and one on a rotation stage attached to the translation stage. Additionally, it is desirable to have a temperature-controlled sample stage which does not leak too much heat, and (for the sake of convenience) a quick-change sample holder which I chose to be based on 1 inch by 3 inch glass slides for their ubiquitous availability. Attached below is a quick bill of materials for the system, the overall price of which I estimate at about $2800 USD depending on what components and tools you may have already available. </p>

        <p>The VdW system is built around a 3D machined chuck that is designed to allow a vacuum to hold down the chip that the VdW heterostructure will be assembled onto, as well as have room for a cartridge heater port and a k-type thermocouple in the form of a washer that can mount to the chuck. I find that aluminum is a good material for the construction of the chuck due to its high thermal conductivity, low expense, and ease of machining. Standard swagelok fittings are used in the construction of the vacuum pass-through, and teflon washers and bolts are used to attach the chuck loosely to a Thor Labs optical breadboard so as to mitigate the amount of heat loss from the chuck to the remainder of the system. Plans and renderings of the chuck are included below, as well as a finite elements thermal analysis for the heating power that our cartridge heater can supply in order to determine maximum strains that we can expect when operating the chuck at the highest temperatures we might want to use. For ease of use, I am including the <a href="/doc/VdW_Chuck.step">3D STEP</a> and also <a href="/doc/VdW_Chuck.FCStd">FreeCad</a> plans. </p>

        <p>Microscopes are expensive, there's not much getting around that. Modular microscopes are no exception and one that I priced out from Olympus turned out to be a little more than what I wanted to spend on the project. It turns out that you can get a similarly capable system made by yourself from Thor Labs components for a lot less. For the sake of completeness here, I am including a bill of materials from Olympus based on their BXFM platform. Red strikethrough denotes components that I believed were unnecessary to the functionality that I was searching for, or components that I already had available to me. Even with many items removed, the price of the system exceeds $5500 USD which is a bit spendy, especially when you already have several very pricy microscopes in your lab to begin with. </p>
